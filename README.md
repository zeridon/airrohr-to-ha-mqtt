# airRohr to home-assistant via MQTT
[Sensor.Community](https://sensor.community) has instructions how to [build](https://sensor.community/en/sensors/) your own sensors. They provide a nice map and some functionality. There is also an integration ([Luftdaten](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/luftdaten/) to pull a station data inside home assistant. Unfortunately this goes over the internet and so is not quite desirable.

This simple daemon will help you to integrate the sensor station into home assistant via MQTT.
